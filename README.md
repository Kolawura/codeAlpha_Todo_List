todo list using vanilla TypeScript and TailwindCSS, toke me just 2 or 3 hours to build(thats still too much but i spent time on the disigning though).
the annoying part is the deployment, spent days on that, i used vite to bundle the project, and vercel refuse to deploye it for me, i dont know why
but i guess they just want to stress me sha, thank God for Netlify üëç.
This is the link to this project: https://kolawura-todo-list.netlify.app/
